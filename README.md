# bpfvalidator

This is a simple tool that spawns qemu machines to test a specific binary on these machines. This is particularly useful for testing eBPF programs against different kernel versions.
Under the hood it uses [virtme-ng](https://github.com/arighi/virtme-ng) tool to create qemu instancies.
Given this configuration file:

```yaml
vng_path: "vng" # absolute path or should be in PATH
bin_command: "/usr/bin/echo 'hey'" # command to run in the qemu machines
parallel: 1 # number of parallel qemu machines to spawn
out_path: "" # if provided, the report will be saved in this file
kernel_versions:
    - v5.4.293
    - v5.10.237
    - v5.15.182
```

bpfvalidator will:

- create 3 qemu machines with the kernel versions specified in the configuration file
- run the command `/usr/bin/echo 'hey'` in each of them
- wait for the command to finish
- collect the output of the command
- generate a report telling if the command passed or failed

```bash
bpfvalidator --config config.yaml
```

```txt
Report:
- v5.4.293 游릭
- v5.10.237 游릭
- v5.15.182 游릭
```

it is possible to obtain also a verbose version of the report using `--log debug` flag:

```bash
bpfvalidator --config config.yaml --log debug
```

```txt
Report:
- v5.4.293 游릭
        message: hey

- v5.10.237 游릭
        message: hey

- v5.15.182 游릭
        message: hey
```

## Report

- 游릭: the command passed
- 游댮: the command failed
- 游리: the provided machine doesn't exist

Example

```txt
- v7.9.0 游리 #the provided machine doesn't exists
- v5.10.237 游릭 # success
- v5.15.182 游댮 # failure
```

## Build and run

```bash
go build .
./bpfvalidator
```
